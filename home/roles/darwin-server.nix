# home-manager configuration for the Macs that run unattended.
#
# A server Mac runs the same shell, editor and CLI tools as any other — those
# are in home/common.nix and home/darwin.nix — and the only thing it does not
# want is the desktop applications, which it gets by not importing the laptop
# role. What lands here is tooling this machine alone has a use for.
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  # Rust straight from nixpkgs, not through rustup.
  #
  # rustup earns its place when a project pins a toolchain in
  # rust-toolchain.toml, or when several versions have to coexist and switch
  # per directory. Neither applies here — one current toolchain is the whole
  # requirement — and what it costs is the property this repository exists for:
  # rustup downloads its toolchains into ~/.rustup at run time, so the compiler
  # on this machine would be whatever it last fetched rather than what
  # flake.lock pins, and a rebuild from this flake would not reproduce it.
  # rust-overlay or fenix is the declarative answer if per-project pinning ever
  # does become the requirement; rustup is not.
  #
  # wasm needs no extra step. nixpkgs configures rustc with
  # `--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown,wasm32v1-none,…` next to the host target,
  # so the standard library for both is built into the package already and
  # `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` works as it stands. There is
  # nothing here corresponding to `rustup target add`. What is genuinely
  # separate is the tooling that wraps the output — wasm-bindgen-cli,
  # wasm-pack, binaryen — and none of it is listed because nothing has asked
  # for it yet.
  #
  # Both packages are needed: rustc is the compiler alone, and cargo is a
  # separate derivation in nixpkgs rather than something it brings along.
